					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<p>I’m Shirealeth Acorda, a second-year Information Technology 
					student specializing in Web and Mobile Application Development. I am Currently
					studying in FEU Institute of Technology.</p>
					<p>I'm an aspiring IT professional with a growing passion for technology and 
					innovation. I enjoy the process of building things from scratch—whether it’s a 
					website or a functional mobile app. Each line of code feels like a 
					puzzle piece coming together to form a bigger picture. I’m driven by curiosity, 
					creativity, and the desire to create solutions that make life easier, 
					more connected, and more enjoyable. I’m exploring how design, function, and 
					innovation can come together to build meaningful digital experiences. 
					My goal is to become a developer who creates tools that are not only efficient 
					but also intuitive and inclusive.</p>
					<p>This website is a glimpse into my journey as I continue to learn, build, 
					and grow.</p>
